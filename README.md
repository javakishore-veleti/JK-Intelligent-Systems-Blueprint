## 1. Product Vision

To empower manufacturing, industrial, and machinery enterprises with a suite of AI-driven products that make organizational knowledge accessible, actionable, and intelligent — bridging the gap between data, people, and decisions.

- Each product solves a real business problem — improving speed, consistency, and productivity without requiring AI expertise from users.
